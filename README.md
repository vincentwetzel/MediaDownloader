# LzyDownloader (C++ Port)

A lightweight, high-performance desktop application for downloading media (video and audio) from online platforms using **yt-dlp**.

**This is a C++ port of the original Python application.** It is designed to be a drop-in replacement, offering faster startup times, lower memory usage, and a native look and feel while maintaining full compatibility with existing user settings and download history.

## Features

- 🎬 **Download Video & Audio** — Support for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and 1000+ other sites via yt-dlp
- 🎵 **Audio Extraction** — Extract audio as MP3, M4A, opus, or other formats
- 📋 **Playlist Support** — Download entire playlists with configurable behavior
- 🖼️ **Gallery Support** — Download image galleries from supported sites (e.g., Instagram, Twitter) via `gallery-dl`
- 🎨 **Advanced Settings** — Quality selection, format filtering, SponsorBlock integration, metadata embedding
- 🎛️ **Runtime Format Selection** — Optionally prompt for specific video/audio qualities on every download, supporting multiple simultaneous format selections for the same media
- 🔄 **Auto-Update** — Checks GitHub for newer releases and updates silently
- 📊 **Concurrent Downloads** — Queue and manage multiple downloads simultaneously
- 🖼️ **Thumbnail Embedding** — Automatic thumbnail download and embedding for videos and audio
- 🌐 **Browser Cookies** — Use saved cookies from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or other browsers for age-restricted content
- 📂 **Smart Sorting** — Automatically organize downloads into subfolders based on uploader, playlist, date, or custom patterns

## Installation

### Windows (Recommended)

Download the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/vincentwetzel/LzyDownloader/releases):

1. Download `LzyDownloader-Setup-X.X.X.exe`
2. Run the installer
3. Launch from Start Menu or desktop shortcut

**Note for existing users:** The installer will automatically replace your existing Python version of LzyDownloader. Your settings and download history will be preserved.

### From Source

Requires CMake, a C++20 compatible compiler (MSVC recommended on Windows), and Qt 6.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vincentwetzel/LzyDownloader.git
cd LzyDownloader

# Configure and build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** (`LzyDownloader.exe`)
2. **Enter a URL** in the "Start Download" tab
3. **Configure options** (quality, format, SponsorBlock, etc.)
4. **Click Download** to start
5. **Monitor progress** in the "Active Downloads" tab
6. **Find completed files** in your configured output folder

## Configuration

All settings are saved to `settings.ini` and persist between sessions. The format is identical to the Python version, ensuring seamless migration.

- **Output folder** — Where completed downloads are saved
- **Temporary folder** — Where downloads are cached during progress
- **Quality/Format** — Video/audio codec and quality preferences
- **Metadata** — Embed titles, artists, and thumbnails
- **SponsorBlock** — Automatically skip sponsored segments
- **Browser Cookies** — Select a browser to use for authentication

## Architecture

The application is built using **C++20** and the **Qt 6** framework.
